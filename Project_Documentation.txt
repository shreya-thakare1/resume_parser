RESUME PARSER TASK DOCUMENTATION

1.  Introduction This task is a Resume Parser developed in Python.
    Its purpose is to automatically read resumes in PDF format and
    extract useful information such as skills, education, and
    experience. Instead of manually reading resumes, this script
    performs the task instantly using text processing and NLP
    techniques.

2.  Objective The goal of this task is to understand how Natural
    Language Processing works in real applications and how automation
    can simplify repetitive tasks like resume screening.

3.  Tools & Technologies Used

-   Python – main programming language
-   Regex – used to detect sections
-   pdfplumber – extracts text from PDF
-   spaCy – performs NLP and entity recognition

4.  Working Principle
Step 1 – The script loads the resume PDF. 
Step 2 – It extracts all text from each page. 
Step 3 – Regex patterns locate section headings. 
Step 4 – Extracted sections are stored separately.
Step 5 – spaCy processes text and detects entities. 
Step 6 – Output is printed in structured format.

5.  Installation Steps Install required libraries: pip install
    pdfplumber spacy

Download NLP model: python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

6.  How to Run Place your resume PDF in the project folder and run:
    python resume_parser.py

7.  Output The script displays detected sections and top entities found
    in the resume.

8.  Learning Outcome Through this project, we learn:

-   How PDF text extraction works
-   How regex pattern matching works
-   Basics of NLP
-   How real automation tools are designed

9.  Future Improvements

-   Add support for Word resumes
-   Build web interface
-   Add skill ranking system
-   Store results in database

Conclusion This task is a practical demonstration of combining
Python, text processing, and NLP to build a real‑world useful tool. It
is simple, educational, and scalable for future improvements.

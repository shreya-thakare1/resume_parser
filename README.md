# resume_parser
Built a smart Resume Parser using Python that automatically extracts key details like Skills, Education, and Experience from resumes. Combined Regex and NLP (spaCy) to turn unstructured resume data into clean, structured information. This project helped me understand real-world text processing and how automation can simplify recruitment workflows.
